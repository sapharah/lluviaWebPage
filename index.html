		<p>Lluvia is a signifigant part of the Prescod family. When I was younger, my brother Jesse and I were best friends. We played video games together, went to the park and did stunts, and we'd ride in the car blasting music and getting into car accidents. But I lost my best friend when he left to college. I was alone and devestated. I felt like an only child.Soon we moved to Texas in a large empty house, so I relentlessly begged for a dog and my mom said no over and over again. But with much persistence, she eventually gave in and Lluvia arrived. </p>

		<p>We quickly learned that she loved her food and treats.<br> She would fight for any little scraps of food or bones.<br> When she spotted or smelled food, that was her ultimate focus.<br> The house could be burning down and she'd still go after the food <br> before saving herself.</p>

		<p>She absolutely hated baths. And everytime she saw you getting <br> the bath supplies out, she would hide and make you go look for <br> her. She could be stubborn when she was ready. </p>
